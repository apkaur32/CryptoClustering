# CryptoClustering
Challenge#19 HW

Instructions
Rename the Crypto_Clustering_starter_code.ipynb file as Crypto_Clustering.ipynb.

Load the crypto_market_data.csv into a DataFrame.

Get the summary statistics and plot the data to see what the data looks like before proceeding.

1. Prepare the Data
Use the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.

Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

2. Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame

3. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data

4.  Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis

5.  Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data

6.  Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
    Answer the following question: What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
